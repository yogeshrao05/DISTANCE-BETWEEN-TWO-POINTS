# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:

Step 1:
Using import math function,do the calculations.

Step 2:
Take the two coordinates as l1 and l2.

Step 3:
Substitute the values in the distance formula

formula

Step 4:
using the print function, display the distance between the two points.

Step 5:
End the program.

### PROGRAM:
```
import math
d1 = [4,2]
d2 = [10,6]
dist = math.sqrt((d2[0]-d1[0])**2+(d2[1]-d1[1])**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(dist))

### OUTPUT:
```
